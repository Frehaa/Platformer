## How the player character lands after falling

Depending on how fast and how curved a fall is, together with the curvature and material of the ground, determines how the player lands. The landings can result in a __High impact__ landing, where the player is stunned dependent of how fast the fall was. It can result in an __Idle__ or __Running__ landing if the fall wasn’t very fast and whether the player was moving while landing or not. Finally the landing can result in a __Sliding__ landing where the player slides the remaining speed off of the ground. Depending on the curvature and the material of the ground the player lands on can result in and idle landing becoming a sliding one, if for example the ground is curved and made of ice. If the ground is soft enough a high impact landing might even become an idle one.

### High speed landings

High speed landings can result in eight different scenarios, with two types of landings namely high impact and sliding:
###### 1.  High speed straight into the ground results in a high impact landing

Note that this isn’t only when falling straight down, but also when flying straight into a wall with high speed. Generally when moving straight into something with high speed the landing will be a high impact one.


###### 2.	High speed curved into the ground results in a high impact landing

Same as 1. but for landings where the player is moving slightly to one or another side. If the landing is fast enough for a high impact landing as per 1. then the landing is fast enough for a high impact even with a slight curve (For sharp curves another rule apply)


###### 3.	High speed along the ground results in a sliding landing

If the speed is more along the ground than into the ground the landing can result in a sliding landing. This is however not possible from player movement while airborne alone, there has to be something sending the player flying along the ground.


###### 4.	High speed onto a slope results in a high impact landing if the speed is high enough and the slope is flat enough with some friction

Mostly dependent on the slope angle and material, a high speed impact with a slope results in a high impact when the slope has a mostly flat angle and the material has some friction.


###### 5.	High speed onto a slope with a curve matching the slope results in a high impact landing if the downwards speed is high enough and the slope is flat enough with some friction

Same as 4. but for landing where the player is moving with the curve of the slope. This landing is less likely to result in a high impact landing than 4. but it is still possible dependent on different factors


###### 6.	High speed onto a slope with a curve towards the slope results in a high impact landing if the angle towards the slope is high enough and somewhat dependent on the material of the slope

 This is the same rule as 1. but for slope and curved landings. If the landing is high speed with an entry angle of around 90 degree the landing will result in a high impact landing whether even if the material is frictionless, though same as with 1. there are exceptions where the material is soft enough that the landing won’t result in a high impact one. Compared to rule 5. when the player moves towards the slope the landing is more likely to result in a high impact one.


###### 7.	High speed onto a slope results in a sliding landing if the speed is low enough and the slope angle is high enough without much friction

This is the other scenario for 4. for high speed landings. If the landing doesn’t result in a high impact landing it will result in a sliding landing.


###### .	High speed onto a slope with a curve matching the slope results in a sliding landing if the speed is low enough and the slope angle is high enough without much friction

This is the other scenario for 5. for high speed landings. If the landing doesn’t result in a high impact landing it will result in a sliding landing.
